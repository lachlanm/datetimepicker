#DateTimePicker 

DateTimePicker is a library which contains the beautiful DatePicker and TimePicker that can be seen in the new Google Agenda app.

**This picker is available for 2.1+**

You have a recurrence picker in the same style [here](https://github.com/Shusshu/Android-RecurrencePicker).

## WARNING

* Requires android-appcompat-v7 and [NineOldAndroids][5]
* Accessibility is missing for DatePicker on all devices and Below ICS devices for TimePicker.

## Description

This library reproduces as much as possible the original picker contained in the new Google Agenda app.
